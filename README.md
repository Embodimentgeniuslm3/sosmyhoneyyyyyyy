## Dependencies
This guide mostly assumes you're using OSX or Linux. The setup process may differ on Windows machines.

1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

1. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

  Sass will soon be replaced with [Less](http://lesscss.org/) to remove the Ruby dependency.

1. [PHP](http://php.net/)

  PHP is for rendering partials in the views and for the [Intuition](https://github.com/Krinkle/intuition) i18n framework. There otherwise is no backend logic.

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

1. [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and a SCSS linter

  The linters are not necessary, but preferred so your code maintains a consistent style.

This first time around you'll need to install all node pacakges and dependencies with `npm install`. You'll also need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run `composer update`.

## Configuration

Create a copy of `config.sample.php` named `config.php`, and within that file, set `ROOTDIR` to your project root path.

## Implementation approach
This app aims to be a part of the future and not linger in the past. JavaScript is written in [ES6](http://es6-features.org/)
where possible, and compiled to ES5 with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) when you run Grunt. If you _need_ to add a polyfill for
something, add it to `/javascript/shared/polyfills.js`. Don't use jQuery utilities when native JavaScript can do it.

For CSS don't worry about adding vendor prefixes to anything in the CSS3 spec. If it works in Chrome and Firefox, leave it
at that. Other browsers will still function without the styling. Use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) classes if possible.

[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) is used to help follow a module pattern. You'll need to `require('./file_name')` any file that is a dependency.

[JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) is the preferred comment format. Try to document each function you create. The linters will complain if you don't!

IE10 and Safari 8 and below are not supported.

## Compilation
All assets and views are ultimated placed in `public_html`. With the exception of images, you won't need to make any manual modifications to this directory.

### Structure
The repo contains six separate applications that share code with each other (Pageviews, Langviews, Topviews, Siteviews, Massviews and Redirect Views). The root directory of `javascripts`, `stylesheets` and `views` represent the Pageviews app. Other apps have a subdirectory therein. The main asset files share the same name as the app (e.g. `pageviews.js` for the main JavaScript file for Pageviews). Partials of any kind are prepended with underscores (e.g. `_footer.php`).

#### JavaScripts
Each app has it's own `config.js`, which are constants for application-wide use. When the JS files are compiled, they are concatenated into a single `application.js` that lives within the directory for that app inside `public_html`. If you compile for non-production source maps will be included.

Shared JavaScript goes in the `/shared` directory and will be automatically included in each `application.js`.

All JavaScript is documented using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/). The documentation is hosted at https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/jsdocs. You can generate the docs locally by running:
```
grunt jsdoc && open doc/PageViews/1.0.0/index.html
```

#### Sass
Because of implications with concatenation, each SCSS file is first compiled into a file with the same name within `public_html`, and _then_ concatentated into an `application.css` which is included in the views.

Each page has it's own `.scss` file that imports dependencies.

#### Haml
The views within `/views` are written in [Haml](https://github.com/arnaud-lb/MtHaml) and compiled to PHP files in `/public_html`. `grunt watch` can be configured to do this whenever you hit save on any view (same is true of JavaScript and Sass).

### Local
Run `grunt pageviews` for the main Pageviews app, or `grunt topviews` for Topviews, etc. To save time, you can run `grunt browserify` to compile only the JavaScript, `grunt haml` for the views, or `grunt sass` for the SASS.

### Production
Before making a pull request or pushing to master, remember to run `grunt production` so the assets are minified and concatenated.

## Tests
Tests will be ran automatically when you push or create a pull request.

### Acceptance
Prerequisites:
* [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Selenium Standalone Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)
* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox-download)

Note the default browser Selenium uses is Firefox, and as of Firefox 47 the necessary webdriver, `FirefoxDriver` has been removed. A working combination is Selenium WebDriver 2.53.1 and Firefox 47.0.1 (not Firefox 47, or later versions than 47.0.1). Once installed run `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar` to start the selenium server and `./nightwatch` to run the tests. You can run specific tests with `./nightwatch --test tests/my_test.js`.

If a test fails when you push to remote, check the build and there will be a link to a video of the test, along with the output of the logs.

### Linters
The styling of all ES6 and SCSS is enforced with linters. You can run these locally with `grunt lint`, and will also be ran when you run `grunt production`. If for some reason you need a particular rule to be ignored, you can add exceptions (see [Scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint/blob/master/lib/scss_lint/linter/README.md#disablelinterreason), [Eslint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)).
